Narrator: "First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and generously grease a muffin tin with butter, ensuring they won't stick."

Narrator: "In a medium bowl, whisk together 10 large eggs, 1/2 cup whole milk, 1/2 lb of cooked and crumbled bacon, 1/2 cup chopped green onions, 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Set this flavorful mixture aside."

Narrator: "Next, carefully pour the egg mixture into each muffin cavity, filling them about 3/4 of the way full. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese for that irresistible cheesy finish!"

Narrator: "Pop the muffin tin into the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the egg muffins look set. Be prepared for them to puff up as they cook, and then gently deflate as they cool."

Narrator: "After letting them cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes, remove the Bacon Egg Muffins and serve immediately! These savory delights are perfect for a quick and delicious breakfast on busy mornings."
